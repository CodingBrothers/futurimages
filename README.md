Warning:  
This is a made up pet project coded by two brothers ([Dusan](//github.com/dkaloc) and [Premysl](//github.com/premysl-kaloc)) in (roughly) two weeks.  
It's only purpose was to get the very first hands-on experience with the [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs) platform, and the [Apiary.io](https://apiary.io) service.  
If you're still interested what's really in, we encourage you to take a look at the [testing](src/test/java/com/codingbrothers/appengine/testing) package, for instance. We coded a simple JUnit runner which allowed us to declaratively specify which App Engine services are required in the current test and so must be made automatically available (injected).
